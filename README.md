Chord Chart Visualization (Euro Debt Crisis)

In this dashboard, I utilized a custom Chord Chart to visually represent the complex financial relationships between creditor and debtor countries during the Euro Debt Crisis. This chart effectively illustrates bilateral debt flows, allowing users to quickly identify which countries were major lenders and borrowers. The visual design enhances clarity in understanding interdependencies between economies, offering a compelling, interactive way to explore international financial data.
